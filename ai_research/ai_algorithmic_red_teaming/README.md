# üß†üî• AI Algorithmic Red Teaming

A framework and methodology for proactively testing, validating, and hardening AI systems against adversarial threats, systemic risks, and unintended behaviors.

## üö© What is Algorithmic Red Teaming?

AI Algorithmic Red Teaming is a structured, adversarial testing process that simulates real-world attacks and misuse scenarios against AI models, systems, and infrastructure. It mirrors traditional cybersecurity red teaming ‚Äî but focuses on probing the **behavior, bias, robustness, and resilience** of machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) systems.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Expose vulnerabilities** in AI systems through adversarial testing
- **Evaluate robustness** to adversarial inputs, data poisoning, and model extraction
- **Test system alignment** with security, privacy, and ethical policies
- **Validate controls** against overreliance, excessive agency, prompt injection, and insecure plugin design
- **Contribute to AI safety and governance** efforts by documenting and mitigating critical risks

## üß© Key Components

### 1. Attack Categories
- **Prompt Injection & Jailbreaking**
- **Model Evasion (Adversarial Examples)**
- **Data Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks**
- **Model Extraction (Stealing)**
- **Inference Manipulation & Overreliance**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure**
- **Insecure Plugin / Tool Use**
- **RAG-Specific Attacks (Embedding Manipulation, Vector Leakage)**

### 2. Evaluation Metrics
- Attack success rate
- Confidence degradation
- Output alignment drift
- Hallucination frequency
- Guardrail bypass percentage
- Latency and inference impact

### 3. Test Surfaces
- LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, open-source)
- Embedding models and vector databases
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Plugin-based LLM architectures
- Agentic AI frameworks (e.g., CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, and others)
- Proprietary models in deployment environments
