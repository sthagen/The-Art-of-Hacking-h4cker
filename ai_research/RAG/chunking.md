# What is Chunking?

**Chunking is the process of breaking down large documents or long pieces of text into smaller, more manageable segments, or "chunks."** This is a fundamental step in preparing your knowledge base for a RAG system.

Why do we do this? Imagine trying to find a specific sentence in an entire book without an index. Now imagine finding it if the book was already broken down into chapters, then sections, and then paragraphs. Chunking does precisely that for your RAG system.

## Why is Chunking Essential for RAG?

Chunking isn't just a best practice; it's a necessity for several key reasons:

* **LLM Context Window Limitations**: Large Language Models have a finite **context window**, which is the maximum amount of text they can process at one time. If you try to feed an entire long document into an LLM, it will quickly exceed this limit, leading to truncated input and potentially missed information. Chunking ensures that the retrieved information fits within the LLM's capacity.
* **Improved Relevance of Embeddings**: When you generate an embedding for a very long document, the embedding can become "diluted." It tries to capture the meaning of *everything* in the document, making it less specific to any single point. Smaller, more focused chunks lead to **more precise and relevant embeddings**. This means that when a user asks a specific question, the similarity search is more likely to retrieve highly relevant chunks rather than broad, less useful documents.
* **Reduced Noise**: If an LLM receives an entire long document, it has to sift through a lot of irrelevant information to find the answer. Smaller chunks reduce this "noise," allowing the LLM to focus on the truly pertinent details from the retrieved context. This can lead to more accurate and concise answers.
* **Cost-Effectiveness**: Processing fewer tokens (from smaller chunks) generally translates to lower computational costs when interacting with LLMs, especially with API-based models.

## Key Considerations for Chunking

When designing your chunking strategy, there are several factors to consider:

* **Chunk Size**: This is arguably the most critical parameter.
    * **Too small**: Chunks might lack sufficient context to answer a question. For example, a single sentence might not make sense without its preceding or following sentences.
    * **Too large**: Chunks might exceed the LLM's context window, or contain too much irrelevant information, diluting the embedding.
    * **Optimal size**: Often depends on the domain and the nature of your documents. A common starting point is between **200 to 500 tokens** (or characters), often with some overlap.
* **Overlap**: Including a small amount of **overlap** between consecutive chunks (e.g., 10-20% of the chunk size) is a common and effective strategy. This helps ensure that context isn't lost at the boundaries between chunks, as crucial information might span across two segments.
* **Semantic Coherence**: Ideally, chunks should represent **semantically complete units of information**. This is challenging to automate perfectly but is a guiding principle.

## Common Chunking Strategies

Here are some of the most prevalent chunking strategies:

1.  ### Fixed-Size Chunking
    This is the simplest and most common approach.
    * **How it works**: Documents are split into segments of a predetermined number of tokens or characters.
    * **Pros**: Easy to implement, predictable chunk sizes.
    * **Cons**: Can cut sentences or paragraphs mid-way, potentially breaking semantic coherence.

2.  ### Delimiter-Based Chunking (Recursive Text Splitting)
    This strategy tries to maintain some semantic structure.
    * **How it works**: Documents are split based on common delimiters like paragraphs, sentences, or even custom separators (e.g., section headings, bullet points). If a resulting segment is too large, it can be recursively split further using smaller delimiters.
    * **Pros**: Tends to produce more semantically coherent chunks by respecting natural document structure.
    * **Cons**: Still might result in chunks that are too large or too small, and sometimes doesn't perfectly capture complex relationships.

3.  ### Content-Aware Chunking (Advanced Techniques)
    These strategies aim for even greater semantic relevance.
    * **Sentence Transformers based chunking**: Some advanced methods use embedding models themselves to identify sentence boundaries or thematic shifts to create more meaningful chunks.
    * **Summary or Outline-based Chunking**: For very long documents like books, you might first generate an outline or summaries of sections, and then chunk based on these higher-level structures.
    * **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining fixed-size chunking with delimiter-based methods, or using LLMs to guide chunking based on semantic understanding.

## Best Practices for Chunking

* **Experimentation is Key**: There's no one-size-fits-all chunking strategy. The optimal approach depends heavily on your specific data, the types of questions users will ask, and the LLM you're using. **Experiment with different chunk sizes and overlaps.**
* **Consider your data source**: Structured data (e.g., tables, code) might require different chunking approaches than free-form text.
* **Evaluate Retrieval Quality**: After chunking, test your RAG system. Are the retrieved chunks actually relevant to the queries? Do they contain enough context for the LLM to answer accurately?
* **Iterate**: Chunking is often an iterative process. You might start with a simple strategy, evaluate its performance, and then refine it based on your observations.
