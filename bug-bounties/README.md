# Bug Bounty Tips and Information

Here’s a straightforward introduction to bug bounties and a roadmap for getting started.

## What Is a Bug Bounty?

A **bug bounty** program is an offer by organizations (often via a platform like HackerOne, Bugcrowd or Synack) to reward security researchers for finding and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities in their systems. Instead of hiring full‑time pentesters, many companies crowdsource testing to a global community, paying per valid finding.

## Why Participate?

* **Real‑world impact:** You help make widely used software more secure.
* **Skill growth:** You hone vulnerability‑finding techniques on live targets.
* **Earnings potential:** Payouts range from tens to tens of thousands of dollars per bug.
* **Community, gaining experience & reputation:** Build your resume or potentially even a hall‑of‑fame profile on bug‑bounty platforms.

## Prerequisites & Foundations

Before diving in, make sure you’ve got:

1. **Basic web and network security knowledge**

   * HTTP, DNS, SSL/TLS, common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
2. **Familiarity with pentesting tools**

   * Burp Suite (or OWASP ZAP), nmap, curl, your browser’s dev tools.
3. **Programming/scripting comfort**

   * At least one language (Python, JavaScript, Bash) to automate tests.

## Choosing Your First Program

1. **Start small:** Look for “low‑complexity” or “public reconnaissance” targets.
2. **Read the policy:** Each program’s scope, in‑scope assets, and disallowed tests vary.
3. **Check hall of fame:** Review disclosed reports to see what others are finding.

## First Steps

1. **Sign up on a platform:** Create profiles on HackerOne, Bugcrowd, maybe GitHub’s Security Lab.
2. **Complete training labs:** Try free labs like PortSwigger Academy, OWASP Juice Shop, O'Reilly, Hack The Box, ✨[Network Academy: Ethical Hacker Free Course (34 labs!)](https://skillsforall.com/course/ethical-hacker?courseLang=en-US)
3. **Set up your toolkit:**
   * Burp (community edition is fine to start)
   * ZAP
   * nmap, nuclei, gobuster, ffuf, etc. for discovery
   * an intercepting proxy plugin or Burp extension collection
4. **Pick a target:** Navigate through the programs and pick one.
5. **Do reconnaissance:** Map out endpoints, parameters, auth flows, error messages.

## Writing Your First Report

* **Be concise and clear:** Explain how to reproduce, impact, and remediation. Probably use AI to help you with these reports.
* **Include PoC steps:** Screenshots, curl commands, or a short script.
* **Respect the disclosure timeline:** Follow the program’s guidelines for report updates and public disclosure.

## Growing Your Skills

* **Learn new vulnerability classes:** Server‑Side Request Forgery, Insecure Deserialization, XXE, etc.
* **Automate repetitive tasks:** Write simple scripts to spot injection points. Specially, nowadays with the use of AI.
* **Join the community:** Follow write‑ups on bug‑bounty blogs, Discord groups, Twitter/LinkedIn threads, etc.
